# ThinkWithYourMind

App submitted to participate in the Swift Student Challenge 2025. ThinkWithYourMind is a narrative game submitted as a single-use app. The app tries to immerse the player in his own psyche, trying to alienate him for a few minutes from the outside world, trying to make him focus only on his own ideas and not conform to the crowd.
